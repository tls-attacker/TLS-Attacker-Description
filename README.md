# TLS-Attacker-Description

This repository contains additional resources for the TLS-Attacker project. Here you can find information about installation, committing to repositories, the project structure, and more. This repository is also contains information about project-internal infrastructure to help everyone be on the same page.

# Project Structure

The main structure of the TLS-Attacker project consists of the following 5 projects. An arrow from e.g. ASN.1-Tool to ModifiableVariable indicates that ModifiableVariable requires ASN.1-Tool as a dependency.

![TLS-Attacker Structure](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Attacker-Description/blob/master/figures/structure.png)

We can see that while Modifiable Variable requires no other project from the TLS-Attacker-Project, TLS-Scanner requires all of them. For an installation reference see [Installation](#Installation).

Most repositories in the TLS-Attacker-Project have a public and a development repository. The development repositories can only be seen by committers such as students or employees and are the location to make pull requests. This way, research results and exploits are not leaked to the public. The public repositories can be seen by anyone and are updated every once in a while with stable versions of the development repositories.

## Modifiable Variable

Public/Development: https://github.com/tls-attacker/ModifiableVariable

Modifiable variable allows one to set modifications to basic types after or before their values are actually determined. When their actual values are determined and one tries to access the value via getters, the original value will be returned in a modified form accordingly.

The concept of modifiable variables is directly or indirectly used by all other repositories in the TLS-Attacker-Project.

## ASN.1-Tool

Public: https://github.com/tls-attacker/ASN.1-Tool

Development: https://github.com/tls-attacker/ASN.1-Tool-Development

ASN.1 Tool is an open-source framework for generating arbitrary ASN.1 structures. The tool also provides mechanisms to define modifications of original ASN.1 values. Resulting binary ASN.1 structures can then be used for further processing in other tools.

The tool is not intended to be used directly, but by other software projects (such as the TLS-Attacker-Project) as a library.

## X.509-Attacker

Public: https://github.com/tls-attacker/X509-Attacker

Development: https://github.com/tls-attacker/X509-Attacker-Development

X.509-Attacker is a tool based on ASN.1 Tool for creating arbitrary certificates; including especially invalid and malformed certificates. Since X.509 certificates encode their contents in ASN.1, this tool extends the features of the ASN.1 Tool in terms of certificate signing. Also, X.509-Attacker introduces a feature of referencing XML elements in order to avoid redundancies when defining certificates in XML.

While X.509-Attacker can be used on its own, the TLS-Attacker-Project uses it as a dependency to create certificates in TLS handshakes.

## TLS-Attacker

Public: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Attacker

Development: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Attacker-Development

TLS-Attacker is a Java-based framework for analyzing TLS libraries. It is able to send arbitrary protocol messages in an arbitrary order to the TLS peer, and define their modifications using a provided interface. This gives the developer an opportunity to easily define a custom TLS protocol flow and test it against his TLS library.

This presents the main tool of the TLS-Attacker-Project, which can send arbitrary messages to servers and execute predefined attacks.

## TLS-Scanner

Public: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Scanner

Development: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Scanner-Development

TLS-Scanner uses TLS-Attacker to test a specific server against multiple known vulnerabilities of TLS-Servers. In the end, TLS-Scanner assigns a score attributing the security of said server. Furthermore, it offers a list of recommendations that increase the security of the server. Test vectors range from key length to known attacks such as Heartbleed
